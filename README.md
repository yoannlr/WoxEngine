# WoxEngine - lightweight C++ game engine

This repository contains the code of a game engine I wrote in 2020.
It hasn't been updated since, but I chose to publish it in case anyone would be interested.

See `main.cpp` an visit the code in `woxengine/` to understand how things work.
Classes and methods have self-explanatory names.
When something has to be explained, the code is commented.
